- **Word Search**: Look up definitions of words.
- **Autocomplete Suggestions**: Provides word suggestions as you type based on a Trie structure.
- **Misspelled Word Suggestions**: Suggests similar words for misspelled entries using the Levenshtein distance.
- **Most Frequent Searches**: Displays the top k most frequently searched words.

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python
- **Data Structures**: Trie, Min-Heap
- **Algorithm**: Levenshtein Distance for word similarity
